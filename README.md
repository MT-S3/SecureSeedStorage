# SecureSeedStorage

The Problem

•	Unhandy seeds to log into wallet

•	Security concerns regarding
o	seed storage
o	copy&paste the seed to the wallet (Spyware)
o	loss of the seed
o	broken Computer

•	No secure Seed-Generator for IOTA
(probably in the new wallet)


The Solution

•	Log into the wallet by simply holding the QR Code in front of your Camera (+optional password) 

•	Security concerns
o	Easily to store, e.g. within a private folder
o	The software types the seed directly to your wallet without using copy&paste
o	You can print it multiple times and store it on different places
(e.g. Friends, as without password you can´t retrieve the seed)
o	You can read it on every computer using this software
->	Also I’ll release a step by step guide explaining how to retrieve the seed just with online tools + your password

•	Cryptographically secure random Seed-Generator
