# SecureSeedStorage

## The Problem
- Unhandy seeds to log into wallet
- Security concerns regarding
  - seed storage
  - copy&paste the seed to the wallet (Spyware)
  - loss of the seed
  - broken Computer
- No secure Seed-Generator for IOTA
(probably in the new UCL wallet)

## The Solution
- Log into the wallet by simply holding the QR Code in front of your Camera (+optional password) 
- Security concerns
  - Easily to store, e.g. within a private folder
  - The software types the seed directly to your wallet without using copy&paste
  - You can print it multiple times and store it on different places
(e.g. Friends, as without password you can´t retrieve the seed)
  - You can read it on every computer using this software
    - Also I’ll release a step by step guide explaining how to retrieve the seed just with online tools + your password
- Cryptographically secure random Seed-Generator
